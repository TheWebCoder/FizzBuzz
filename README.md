## Overview
FizzBuzz is a classic coding challenge and this JavaScript project brings it to life. The program prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz". The twist is that it allows users to input their numbers for "Fizz" and "Buzz"
